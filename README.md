Application I y'am what I y'am

This application is really just my personal application to maintain and administer things that are
important to me. Currently I have a header with a made up business name, however I'm just going to
provide a feature where the header can be changed using the upload feature (modified).

This application was created using an AppFuse archetype. This was setup using Maven with a command
built on this page, http://appfuse.org/display/APF/AppFuse+QuickStart

The application uses Hibernate for persistence and Tapestry for the web framework. I'm using MySQL
for now as the relational database and running the application in a Jetty container locally for use
and testing.
